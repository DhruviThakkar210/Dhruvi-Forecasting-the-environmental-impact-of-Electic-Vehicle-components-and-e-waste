# Main Components of Electric Vehicles

The main components of electric vehicles are :

1. Traction battery pack : A traction battery pack is also known as an Electric vehicle battery (EVB). It powers the electric motors of an electric vehicle. The battery acts as an electrical storage system. It stores energy in the form of DC current. The range will be higher with increasing kW of the battery. The life and operation of the battery depending on its design. The lifetime of a traction battery pack is estimated to be 200,000 miles.

2. DC-DC Converter : The traction battery pack delivers a constant voltage. But different components of the vehicle have different requirements. The DC-DC converter distributes the output power that is coming from the battery to a required level. It also provides the voltage required to charge the auxiliary battery.

3. Electric motor : The electric traction motor is the main component of an electric vehicle. The motor converts electrical energy into kinetic energy. This energy rotates the wheels. An electric motor is the main component that differentiates an electric car from a conventional car. An important feature of an electric motor is the [regenerative braking mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_braking). This mechanism slows down the vehicle by converting its kinetic energy into another form and storing it for future use. There are basically two types of motors DC and AC motors.

4. Power inverter : It converts DC power from the batteries to AC power. It also converts the AC current generated during regenerative braking into a DC current. This is further used to recharge the batteries. The inverter can change the speed of the

5. Charge Port : The charge port connects the electric vehicle to an external supply. It charges the battery pack. The charge port is sometimes located in the front or rear part of the vehicle

6. Onboard charger : The onboard charger is used to convert the AC supply received from the charge port to the DC supply. The onboard charger is located and installed inside the car. It monitors various battery characteristics and controls the current flowing inside the battery pack.

7. Controller : The power electronics controller determines the working of an electric car. It performs the regulation of electrical energy from the batteries to the electric motors. The pedal set by the driver determines the speed of the vehicle and the frequency of variation of voltage that is input to the motor. It also controls the torque produced.

8. Auxiliary batteries : Auxiliary batteries are the source of electrical energy for the accessories in electric vehicles. Without the main battery, the auxiliary batteries will continue to charge the car. It prevents the voltage drop, produced during engine start from affecting the electrical system.

9. Thermal system (cooling) : The thermal management system is responsible for maintaining an operating temperature for the main components of an electric vehicle such as an electric motor, controller, etc. It functions during charging as well to obtain maximum performance. It uses a combination of thermoelectric cooling, forced air cooling, and liquid cooling.

10. Transmission : It is used to transfer the mechanical power from the electric motor to the wheels, through a gearbox. The advantage of electric cars is that they do not require multi-speed transmissions. The transmission efficiency should be high to avoid power loss.

### Types of Electric Vehicles
- [Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)]() : A battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV), often known as an ‘All-Electric Vehicle (AEV)’, is a vehicle powered by a battery and a fully electric system.
- [Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)]() : A Hybrid vehicle is often referred to as a conventional hybrid or a parallel hybrid. HEVs are powered by an IC Engine as well as an electric motor.
- [Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)]() : A PHEV, also known as a series hybrid, is a hybrid model that contains both an ICE and a motor.
- [Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV)]() : Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), also known as fuel cell cars (FCVs) or Zero Emission Vehicles, are fully electric that generate energy using “Fuel Cell Technology.”
